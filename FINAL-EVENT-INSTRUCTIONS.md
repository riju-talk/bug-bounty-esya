## 🎯 EVENT DAY WORKFLOW (60 MINUTES)

### **TEAMS RECEIVE:**
1. **Repository URL**: Your current Replit repository
2. **Bug tracking sheet**: Blank form for teams to track fixes
3. **Instructions**: Git workflow commands below

### **WAVE RELEASE STRATEGY:**
Since git operations are restricted in Replit environment, use **File Distribution Strategy**:

#### **Option 1: Manual File Distribution (Recommended)**
```bash
# Pre-event: Create 4 zip files with progressive bug sets
# Wave 0: Basic bugs only (remove complex security files)
# Wave 1: Add intermediate complexity
# Wave 2: Add all security vulnerabilities  
# Wave 3: Complete nightmare-level challenge
```

#### **Option 2: Live Code Injection (Advanced)**
```bash
# Organizer adds files live during event:
# 15min: Add js/search.js (XSS vulnerabilities)
# 30min: Add js/security-issues.js (advanced attacks)
# 45min: Add remaining nightmare files
```
